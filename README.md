# Assignment 2: Process Synchronization

This project solves the Sleeping Stylist problem using two synchronization mechanisms:

- **Part 1:** POSIX Semaphores (in `sleepingStylistSem.c`)
- **Part 2:** Custom Monitor with user-defined condition variables (in `sleepingStylistMon.c` and `monitor.c`)

Each part is organized in its own subdirectory (`part1/` and `part2/`), and includes:
- A `README.md` file with detailed build/run instructions
- A working implementation of the solution
- A `Makefile` for compilation and cleaning
