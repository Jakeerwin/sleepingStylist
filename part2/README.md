## What to Observe:
- Chairs visualized via debug print: `| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | ...`
- Haircut count increasing
- Salon full and salon empty counters incrementing
- Signal-and-continue behavior is followed: the signaling thread continues inside the monitor, while the signaled thread waits at the entry queue. You can observe this via lack of overlapping debug output or additional `printf` logs in `waitCV`/`signalCV` if enabled.
